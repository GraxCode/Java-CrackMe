# Java-CrackMes
Welcome! This is a collection of hard java crackmes i made.

If you don't know how to write your own deobfuscation tools you should better keep your hands off difficulty 7 - 10 crackmes.

* Java CrackMe 1 (Difficulty: 8/10)
* Java CrackMe 2 (Difficulty: 8/10)
* Java CrackMe 3 (Difficulty: 10/10) (*NEW*)
* Java CrackMe 4 (Difficulty: 4/10) (*NEW*)

For 1 and 2 you will take more than 1 hour guaranteed. For #3 you will probably take a day, and for #4 you can solve it in under 30 minutes.
The goal is to find a working key to input. Keys are 32-bit integers for crackme 1-2 and 64-bit longs for crackme 3. (eg. 123456). Crackme 4 accepts HEX strings with length 16.
Bruteforcing the key is not allowed. Writing a key-gen is probably necessary. Solutions with only the key are *not* accepted. Every crackme has been tested for a working key. There can be multiple solutions.
