# Java-CrackMes
Welcome! This is a collection of hard java crackmes i made.
If you don't know how to write your own deobfuscation tools you should better keep your hands off those crackmes.

* Java CrackMe 1 (Difficulty: 8/10)
* Java CrackMe 2 (Difficulty: 8/10)
* Java CrackMe 3 (Difficulty: 10/10)

You will take more than 1 hour guaranteed. For #3 you will probably take a day.
The goal is to find a working key to input. Keys are 32-bit integers for crackme 1-2 and 64-bit longs for crackme 3. (eg. 123456)
Bruteforcing the key is not allowed. Writing a key-gen is probably necessary. Solutions with only the key are *not* accepted.
