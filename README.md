Welcome! This is a collection of java crackmes i made.

| Crackme       | Difficulty    | Estimated time | Short description    | Key format    | Solution |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | :------: |
| #1            | ★★★☆☆       | 1 hour         | Annoying obfuscation | 32-bit int    | ✓        |
| #2            | ★★★☆☆       | 1.5 hours      | Annoying obfuscation | 32-bit int    | ✗        |
| #3 (*NEW*)    | ★★★★☆       | 6 hours        | Dynamic invokation   | 64-bit long   | ✗        |
| #4 (*NEW*)    | ★★☆☆☆       | 45 minutes     | Easy but tricky      | length 16 hex | ✓        |

The goal is to find a working key to input, without bruteforcing the program, but with writing a keygen (that should not take longer than 30 seconds) or calculating the key by hand. Solutions with only the key are *not* accepted, you should explain how you solved it and attach the keygen you wrote (if you used one). Every crackme has been tested for a working key. There can be multiple solutions. If you want to, you can submit solutions via Issues, and I will add them to the repo
